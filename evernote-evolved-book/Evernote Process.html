I’ve also noticed that when I list todos in Swipes, they aren’t all doable in the moment and can be split into different categories. Swipes has  a great desktop app with a icon in the menu bar in finder that just allows you to write something in it which goes into swipes, a nice little bucket to throw things into. Thats how I have been using it and subsequently I had to go through 100 ideas the next day and split into categories of things like - routine, overall projects, materials to buy, research, etc etc. I’m also planning on buying another big whiteboard for drawing out time based plans.</div><div><br/></div><div>Update 7.4.16</div><div>All short ‘tasks’ now moved into Swipes app - available for iPhone and mac.</div><div>I was having a note for tasks  split into headings like work, finance etc, then using Stephen Covey’s Importance / Urgency matrix but I just found that a text list just lacks format that gives enough satisfaction to tick off and also means that it gets out of hand too quick. There is a temptation to copy non-task like content into it which muddies it’s effectiveness. Not urgent / not important tasks aren’t worth it. Neither not important, but urgent. So they are more like a distraction list. (Urgent, important), (not urgent, important) could be used as tags… but it would be nice to have a ‘space’ to drag tasks into designated a category. A google glass type piece of kit that reminded oneself of things you need to do would also be good, doesn’t have to be complicated, just a reminder mechanism. One hell of  a lot of wisdom is needed to get this right though.</div><div><br/></div><div>Update 2.2.16</div><div>Removing a: finance/getting paid etc, folders because its clear they don’t work. Moving bookmarks into bookmarks manager. Consolidating research into Marxico docs to get an overview e.g. all the a:work docs.Seems to be useful in the sense of being able to assess the research I’ve done faster for insight and a sense of perspective.</div><div><br/></div><div>Update 1.31.16</div><div>Some of the tasks split into Epics / Stories.</div><div><br/></div><div>Update 15.1.15</div><div>In the notes with todo lists, only doable tasks should have a checkbox, otherwise have it as just text in a list (i’m currently experimenting with a  highlight if it is more important or I want to flag it to remember)</div><div><br/></div><div>Update 10.11.15</div><table style="width: 666px;"><colgroup><col style="width: 659px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"><div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; width: 660px; word-wrap: break-word;"><div style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; clear: both;"><div>You probably want tasks that have a clear way of knowing whether they have been completed or not.

So I think it's always better to, say, state 5 steps needed in order to complete a task as separate items that you can complete individually.</div></div><table style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 4px; border: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; width: 100%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 408px;"/><col style="width: 178px;"/></colgroup><tbody style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px;"><tr style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px;"><td style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: top;"><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 2px 0px 0px; border: 0px;"><a href="http://productivity.stackexchange.com/a/14943/7456" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration: none;">share</a><span style="border: 0px; visibility: hidden; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">|</span><a href="http://productivity.stackexchange.com/posts/14943/edit" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration: none;">edit</a><span style="border: 0px; visibility: hidden; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">|</span><a href="http://productivity.stackexchange.com/questions/14940/what-kind-of-tasks-belong-on-to-do-lists-and-which-dont/14943#" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration: none;">flag</a></div></td><td style="margin: 0px; border: 0px; padding: 5px; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; height: 58px;" align="right"><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; height: 35px; width: 190px;"><div style="margin: 2px 0px 4px; padding: 0px; border: 0px;">answered <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; text-decoration: none;" title="2015-11-09 14:04:41Z">6 mins ago</span></div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; float: left; width: 32px; height: 32px;"><div style="margin: 0px; border: 0px; padding: 0px; width: 32px; height: 32px; overflow: hidden;"><div><img src="Evernote%20Process.resources/sHU5h.jpg" height="32" width="32"/><br/></div></div></div><div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; border: 0px; padding: 0px; float: left; width: 150px; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap;"><div><a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;" href="http://productivity.stackexchange.com/users/375/felipe-almeida">Felipe Almeida</a></div><div><span style="margin: 0px 2px 0px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: bold;" dir="ltr" title="reputation score ">141</span><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px;" title="3 bronze badges"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 2px; border: 0px; font-weight: normal;">3</span></span></div></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br/></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br/></div><div>30.10.15</div><div><br/></div><div>swipes offers the ability to create a note, tag it with swipes and then anything in a checkbox list appears in the associated tasks list in the app</div><div>this is what I’m now going to try. I’m hoping this is going to allow me to get a better handle over project tasks that need doing now, which seems to have gone out the window. which is why I shifted to using my mind instead of evernote as much.</div><div><br/></div><div>something else I did was to tag anything with a project name and then stick it in the archive</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>Shared from <a href="http://www.zite.com/?ref=evernote">Zite</a>.</div><div><br/></div><div>19.2.15 update</div><div><br/></div><div>Continuing with success with the GTD stack, I've now removed many of the project folders and am processing the notes through the GTD stack. Quite naturally I began to create ‘action’ folders that the intention is will ‘chunk’ my time into similar kinds of tasks to avoid having too many difficult kinds of activities in daily life and to be able to gain momentum on projects rather than losing momentum by switching too often.</div><div><br/></div><div>---------------</div><div><br/></div><div>28.1.15 update</div><div><br/></div><div>Having implemented the GTD stack, the need for the project archives is diminishing, because the project archives used to represent stuff I had processed for that project. However, I am experiencing that the GTD stack is much more effective way of processing all projects. Its getting more urgent that I’m not going to ever need to go back into individual archives of projects for anything. If anything is referential, then its goes into the reference folder, else it is something that is ‘done’, a task that had to be done that has no or minimal reference value, hence it can go into a catch all ‘completed’ folder.</div><div><br/></div><div>Therefore now what I’ve started doing is I’ve gone into the project folders and I’m tagging all the notes with the name of that project. So that I can then move those notes into my GTD actioning stack ,  process them and then delegate them into the ‘completed’ notebook and yet they will still have a link back to their project, so the project maintains its integrity and doesn’t break down into a swarm of ideas without coherent form. Projects still need their individual note books I think because they represent coherent areas of focus and I’ll sometimes create something in the inbox, that I'm not going to handle right now, and it needs somewhere to live with other things that relate to it, like a long document and some related notes or an article.</div><div><br/></div><div>------------</div><div><br/></div><div>Its clear that some of the stuff requires a mind map . I was doing some research about project management and a common first step is brainstorming or mind mapping or in agile it would be scoping stuff. So in Evernote some notes are decidedly brainstormy in style and therefore this content needs to be in a different format otherwise it ends up looking terribly confusing wirrttne out long hand and with bullet points in Evernote.</div><div><br/></div><div>At some point the use of Evernote is becoming a shuffling around of things. If I don’t engage with them then it is useless. In terms of GTD my Evernote is now definitely a ‘map’ for progress. However, I almost feel like I now need to leave all projects alone for a while and adhoc it - perhaps this is a product of a change in my life rather than the system. 19-8-14</div><div><br/></div><div>"If you want to get something done, decide when and where you’re going to do it. Otherwise, take it off your list"</div><div><br/></div><div>11/8/14 Its helpful to only have one focus project in evernote and to spend some time doing stuff there.</div><div><br/></div><div>4/8/14 It has becoming overwhelming because I can only focus on one thing at a time, therefore it might be better to have only one project in the current projects stack and everything else be on the back burner or perhaps one project now and one project looking to the future somehow. Lets test only having max 2 projects in focus.</div><div><br/></div><div>Edit me</div><div><br/></div><div>Incoming goes into the follow folders:</div><div><br/></div><div>@Ideas / Research is for capturing book and article ideas on the fly.</div><div><br/></div><div>Ideas / Research represents ‘The quest’ part of discovering information and the idea is to pick things out of this quest that are useful. The research that you collect is only useful for its imminent power.

If its tech / dev re business put it in making / logistics first. The only reason I have a tech / dev folder at all is that I have done a lot of work in this area and the nature of it is a lot of text based stuff so it makes sense to have it separate from the making folder which represents more poetic making and making to do with specific projects</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data system</span></div><div><br/></div><div>All superficially sized files and information is kept in Evernote.

So, instead of what I used to do (individual notebooks for Apps Wanted, Movies Wanted, Restaurants Wanted, etc.), I now have one notebook (@Wanted), with notes inside tagged Apps, Movies, Restaurants, Books, etc. To see just a list of the books I want to buy, I use a Saved Search ("Show me just items in the @Wanted folder tagged "books").</div><div><br/></div><div>the benefit has been the total elimination of the question "Now, what folder does this get filed into?" Instead of deciding which of many dozen folders to file an item into, I tag items well and stick 'em into one of four or five places. Fewer decisions = less time deliberating = less friction = more efficiency.</div><div><br/></div><div>In other words: despite having moved to a paperless office, I found myself, out of habit, projecting paper-based filing methods and paper-based concepts (like "I need a fine-grained filing system, because a piece of paper can only be in one place at a time, and I want to find it whenever I need it.") on my paperless system. Now, I'm embracing the speed and efficiency that's gained by a paperless data storage process, and depending on the technology to help me find and bind together whatever I need on the fly.</div><div><br/></div><div>I'm not saying this is superior; it's just what works for me. But if you catch yourself debating, "Now, where do I put *this* note?" or if you feel intimidated by the complexity of all those nested notebooks, you might consider using a maximum of four or five notebooks ... and using tags and Saved Searches as a way of making very focused collections of notes available when needed.</div><div><br/></div><div>Due to a necessity to deconstruct various aspects of business sales &amp; marketing I created an array of notebooks in a stack related to community / connecting, however, this has resulted in numerous notebooks having only a couple of notes in them.</div><div><br/></div><div>What is the point of these notebooks? What will be the outcome? The point of the CC notebooks is to research the process of making people hear about my products and building my community. (What community? How do I know who is in my community for each product. What are the products? Are the markets significant enough?)</div><div><br/></div><div>Thoughts:</div><div>Can some of them be outsourced?</div><div>Can these be made physical somehow - e.g. flash cards &amp; blue tack?</div><div><br/></div><div>A system for archiving and de prioritizing.</div><ul><li><div>Will the project serve the business need?</div></li><li><div>"unclear requirements" are one of the top three causes of failure.</div></li><li><div>What are the dependencies</div></li><li><div>When will the entire project be complete?</div></li><li><div>What will the project cost?</div></li><li><div>What are the uncertainties?</div></li><li><div>How do new priorities come into the list?</div></li><li><div>Scheduling</div></li><li><div>How to coordinate resources?</div></li><li><div>How do you capture your learning?</div></li></ul><div>Using Analytics tools we can identify popular landing pages in sites which posit potential products - e.g. what people value enough to pay for.</div><div>Checking those landing pages we can see what the bounce rate is like. If it is really high then its not achieving its aim, so we should spend time to fix it. We should fix it until it gets to the point where it may actually result in conversions.</div><div><br/></div><div>This makes websites into market research tools in themselves. We can evolve existing website efforts to become more efficient at working for us based on real user behaviour instead of just guessing what people want and even going beyond the 'editing' process.</div><div><br/></div><div><div><br/></div><table style="table-layout: fixed; border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 586px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border: 1px solid rgb(211, 211, 211); width: 586px; padding: 8px;"><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Evernote on Post it Notes</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div><a href="https://www.evernote.com/market/feature/3m">https://www.evernote.com/market/feature/3m</a></div><div><br/></div><div><a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2014/02/20/using-evernote-post-it-notes/">https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2014/02/20/using-evernote-post-it-notes/</a></div><table style="table-layout: fixed; border-collapse: collapse; min-width: 100%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 586px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border: 1px solid rgb(211, 211, 211); width: 586px; padding: 8px;"><div><br/></div><div><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&amp;q=52.480983,-0.813055" style="font-weight: bold;">Map</a></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use Note Links to Connect Essential Content in Evernote</span></div><div><br/></div><div>What will you accomplish in 2015?
